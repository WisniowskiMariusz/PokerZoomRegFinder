# PokerZoomRegFinder
This is Python script for Zoom players pools to find regular players.

Problem: When we playing poker we want to point best players as soon as possible to play versus them different strategy than versus recreational players.

Solution: Most of regular good players using many accounts in zoom playerspool to increase volume. On the other hand poker software doesn't allow to play together players from the same IP. So as long as player is not using many different IPs in the same time it is not possible to more than one account from the same player is playing the same hand. Therefore if find group of accounts playing in the same time but haven't got any single hand player together it is big chance it is the same player on another account.
